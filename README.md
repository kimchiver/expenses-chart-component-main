# Frontend Mentor - Expenses chart component

## Overview

### The assignment

Build out the fees chart component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
The app absorbs the data from a `data.json` file and dynamically add the bars to html.

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file
